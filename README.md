# Shellodoro
Shellodoro - the console pomodoro app on python. In Shellodoro you can choose some preset types of timers or create your own timer. Shellodoro will also save your stats.

- Shellodoro is currently under development

What shellodoro can now:
- Start timer - no
- Choose timer mode - no
- Create timer mode - no
- Save stats - no
- Music signal - no

Yes, shellodoro can't do anything now, but soon he will be able to do all of the above.
